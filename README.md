# MultipleCache-OpenMP-project
For my parallel computer architecture and programming class in undergrad: created a simulation of multiple caches which each runs on a thread, and have some shared resources. Their memory blocks have been also initialized, and the caches have different priorities in handling the request messages coming from the bus (input requests).  For each clock cycle a prioritized thread/cache handles the messages coming from the bus, and also updates the memory block's state according to the read/write operation. 
This was done using the OpenMP Api in C++ in the Visual Studio IDE.
